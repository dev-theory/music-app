## Music App

Build a search engine which will return any tracks, albums or artists partially matching the given keywords. The search terms can be found in any part of the track name, album title or artist name. For example given the search keyword "pre" the following results should be matched:

1. Artist "Pretty Lights"
2. Track "Sunset (Bords of Prey)"
3. Track "Press Pause"

Use the `tracks.json` file included in this repo as an example data input to search.
